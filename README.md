  <b>A Stack</b> to develop, preview, and deploy an Express website to Google App Engine in seconds.
</p>

## Why should you use this stack?
Spin up your own ExpressJS website on Google App Engine in seconds.
The stack also sets up a CI/CD environment by taing care of the following things
1. Branch Naming convention - You can use any branch prefixed with "dev" as your development environment. 
2. Branch Protection Setting - Developers working on this branch can work freely and push changes without a PR and a code reviewer. This facilitates quick development. 
3. Enable Security alerts - A workflow will be setup for you to enable Dependabot alerts to detect vulnerabilities.
4. CodeQL Security Analysis - Discover vulnerabilities across a codebase with CodeQL, our industry-leading semantic code analysis engine

Note: Once you create a repo out of this stack, you can find your website deployed at TBF.
