  <b>A Stack</b> to develop, preview, and deploy an Express website to Google App Engine in seconds.
</p>

## Why should you use this stack? ‚Åâ
Spin up your own ExpressJS website on Google App Engine in seconds.
The stack also sets up a CI/CD environment by taing care of the following things
1. Enable Security alerts - A workflow will be setup for you to enable Dependabot alerts to detect vulnerabilities. üõ°Ô∏è
2. CodeQL Security Analysis - Discover vulnerabilities across a codebase with CodeQL, our industry-leading semantic code analysis engine üñ•Ô∏è

## What are the inputs to pass while setting up the stack? ‚ÑπÔ∏è
-   `workload_identity_provider`: (Required) The full identifier of the Workload Identity
    Provider, including the project number, pool name, and provider name. If
    provided, this must be the full identifier which includes all parts:

    ```text
    projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider
    ```

-   `service_account`: (Required) Email address or unique identifier of the Google Cloud
    service account for which to generate credentials. For example:

    ```text
    my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    ```

-   `audience`: (Required) The value for the audience (`aud`) parameter in the
    generated GitHub Actions OIDC token. This value defaults to the value of
    `workload_identity_provider`, which is also the default value Google Cloud
    expects for the audience parameter on the token. We do not recommend
    changing this value.

For more info on getting these inputs look at the google [auth action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth/blob/main/README.md#inputs) which has in depth details about getting these inputs.
